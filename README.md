# Skin-Cancer-Data-analysis

Hey I created this project by using GAN model on the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
To run this code you have to download the dataset or upload in google collab 
Remove the hashtags from lines 3,4,13,14,15,16,17,19 to download and unzip the dataset in collab
Create a new folder and add the two image files to make them into classes 
This project requires a lot of computing resourses it is not reccomended to run it in google collab if you have the free version
Thank you
